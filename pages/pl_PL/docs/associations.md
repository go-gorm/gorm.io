## Auto Create/Update

GORM will auto-save associations and its reference using [Upsert](create.html#upsert) when creating/updating a record.

```go
user := User{
  Name:            "jinzhu",
  BillingAddress:  Address{Address1: "Billing Address - Address 1"},
  ShippingAddress: Address{Address1: "Shipping Address - Address 1"},
  Emails:          []Email{
    {Email: "jinzhu@example.com"},
    {Email: "jinzhu-2@example.com"},
  },
  Languages:       []Language{
    {Name: "ZH"},
    {Name: "EN"},
  },
}

db.Create(&user)
// BEGIN TRANSACTION;
// INSERT INTO "addresses" (address1) VALUES ("Billing Address - Address 1"), ("Shipping Address - Address 1") ON DUPLICATE KEY DO NOTHING;
// INSERT INTO "users" (name,billing_address_id,shipping_address_id) VALUES ("jinzhu", 1, 2);
// INSERT INTO "emails" (user_id,email) VALUES (111, "jinzhu@example.com"), (111, "jinzhu-2@example.com") ON DUPLICATE KEY DO NOTHING;
// INSERT INTO "languages" ("name") VALUES ('ZH'), ('EN') ON DUPLICATE KEY DO NOTHING;
// INSERT INTO "user_languages" ("user_id","language_id") VALUES (111, 1), (111, 2) ON DUPLICATE KEY DO NOTHING;
// COMMIT;

db.Save(&user)
```

If you want to update associations's data, you should use the `FullSaveAssociations` mode:

```go
db.Session(&gorm.Session{FullSaveAssociations: true}).Updates(&user)
// ...
// INSERT INTO "addresses" (address1) VALUES ("Billing Address - Address 1"), ("Shipping Address - Address 1") ON DUPLICATE KEY SET address1=VALUES(address1);
// INSERT INTO "users" (name,billing_address_id,shipping_address_id) VALUES ("jinzhu", 1, 2);
// INSERT INTO "emails" (user_id,email) VALUES (111, "jinzhu@example.com"), (111, "jinzhu-2@example.com") ON DUPLICATE KEY SET email=VALUES(email);
// ...
```

## Skip Auto Create/Update

To skip the auto save when creating/updating, you can use `Select` or `Omit`, for example:

```go
user := User{
  Name:            "jinzhu",
  BillingAddress:  Address{Address1: "Billing Address - Address 1"},
  ShippingAddress: Address{Address1: "Shipping Address - Address 1"},
  Emails:          []Email{
    {Email: "jinzhu@example.com"},
    {Email: "jinzhu-2@example.com"},
  },
  Languages:       []Language{
    {Name: "ZH"},
    {Name: "EN"},
  },
}

db.Select("Name").Create(&user)
// INSERT INTO "users" (name) VALUES ("jinzhu", 1, 2);

db.Omit("BillingAddress").Create(&user)
// Skip create BillingAddress when creating a user

db.Omit(clause.Associations).Create(&user)
// Skip all associations when creating a user
```

{% note warn %}
**NOTE:** For many2many associations, GORM will upsert the associations before creating the join table references, if you want to skip the upserting of associations, you could skip it like:

```go
db.Omit("Languages.*").Create(&user)
```

The following code will skip the creation of the association and its references

```go
db.Omit("Languages").Create(&user)
```
{% endnote %}

## Select/Omit Association fields

```go
user := User{
  Name:            "jinzhu",
  BillingAddress:  Address{Address1: "Billing Address - Address 1", Address2: "addr2"},
  ShippingAddress: Address{Address1: "Shipping Address - Address 1", Address2: "addr2"},
}

// Create user and his BillingAddress, ShippingAddress
// When creating the BillingAddress only use its address1, address2 fields and omit others
db.Select("BillingAddress.Address1", "BillingAddress.Address2").Create(&user)

db.Omit("BillingAddress.Address2", "BillingAddress.CreatedAt").Create(&user)
```

## Association Mode

Association Mode contains some commonly used helper methods to handle relationships

```go
// Start Association Mode
var user User
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages")
// `user` is the source model, it must contains primary key
// `Languages` is a relationship's field name
// If the above two requirements matched, the AssociationMode should be started successfully, or it should return error
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Error
```

### Find Associations

Find matched associations

```go
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Find(&languages)
```

Find associations with conditions

```go
codes := []string{"zh-CN", "en-US", "ja-JP"}
db.Model(&user).Where("code IN ?", codes).Association("Languages").Find(&languages)

db.Model(&user).Where("code IN ?", codes).Order("code desc").Association("Languages").Find(&languages)
```

### Append Associations

Append new associations for `many to many`, `has many`, replace current association for `has one`, `belongs to`

```go
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Append([]Language{languageZH, languageEN})

db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Append(&Language{Name: "DE"})

db.Model(&user).Association("CreditCard").Append(&CreditCard{Number: "411111111111"})
```

### Replace Associations

Replace current associations with new ones

```go
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Replace([]Language{languageZH, languageEN})

db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Replace(Language{Name: "DE"}, languageEN)
```

### Delete Associations

Remove the relationship between source & arguments if exists, only delete the reference, won't delete those objects from DB.

```go
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Delete([]Language{languageZH, languageEN})
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Delete(languageZH, languageEN)
```

### Clear Associations

Remove all reference between source & association, won't delete those associations

```go
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Clear()
```

### Count Associations

Return the count of current associations

```go
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Count()

// Count with conditions
codes := []string{"zh-CN", "en-US", "ja-JP"}
db.Model(&user).Where("code IN ?", codes).Association("Languages").Count()
```

### Batch Data

Association Mode supports batch data, e.g:

```go
// Find all roles for all users
db.Model(&users).Association("Role").Find(&roles)

// Delete User A from all user's team
db.Model(&users).Association("Team").Delete(&userA)

// Get distinct count of all users' teams
db.Model(&users).Association("Team").Count()

// For `Append`, `Replace` with batch data, the length of the arguments needs to be equal to the data's length or else it will return an error
var users = []User{user1, user2, user3}
// e.g: we have 3 users, Append userA to user1's team, append userB to user2's team, append userA, userB and userC to user3's team
db.Model(&users).Association("Team").Append(&userA, &userB, &[]User{userA, userB, userC})
// Reset user1's team to userAï¼Œreset user2's team to userB, reset user3's team to userA, userB and userC
db.Model(&users).Association("Team").Replace(&userA, &userB, &[]User{userA, userB, userC})
```

## <span id="delete_with_select">Delete with Select</span>

You are allowed to delete selected has one/has many/many2many relations with `Select` when deleting records, for example:

```go
// delete user's account when deleting user
db.Select("Account").Delete(&user)

// delete user's Orders, CreditCards relations when deleting user
db.Select("Orders", "CreditCards").Delete(&user)

// delete user's has one/many/many2many relations when deleting user
db.Select(clause.Associations).Delete(&user)

// delete each user's account when deleting users
db.Select("Account").Delete(&users)
```

{% note warn %}
**NOTE:** Associations will only be deleted if the deleting records's primary key is not zero, GORM will use those priamry keys as conditions to delete selected associations

```go
// DOESN'T WORK
db.Select("Account").Where("name = ?", "jinzhu").Delete(&User{})
// will delete all user with name `jinzhu`, but those user's account won't be deleted

db.Select("Account").Where("name = ?", "jinzhu").Delete(&User{ID: 1})
// will delete the user with name = `jinzhu` and id = `1`, and user `1`'s account will be deleted

db.Select("Account").Delete(&User{ID: 1})
// will delete the user with id = `1`, and user `1`'s account will be deleted
```
