## 自动创建、更新

GORM在创建或更新记录时会自动地保存其关联和引用，主要使用upsert技术来更新现有关联的外键引用。

### 在创建时自动保存关联

当你创建一条新的记录时，GORM会自动保存它的关联数据。 这个过程包括向关联表插入数据以及维护外键引用。

```go
user := User{
  Name:            "jinzhu",
  BillingAddress:  Address{Address1: "Billing Address - Address 1"},
  ShippingAddress: Address{Address1: "Shipping Address - Address 1"},
  Emails:          []Email{
    {Email: "jinzhu@example.com"},
    {Email: "jinzhu-2@example.com"},
  },
  Languages:       []Language{
    {Name: "ZH"},
    {Name: "EN"},
  },
}

// 创建用户及其关联的地址、电子邮件和语言
db.Create(&user)
// BEGIN TRANSACTION;
// INSERT INTO "addresses" (address1) VALUES ("Billing Address - Address 1"), ("Shipping Address - Address 1") ON DUPLICATE KEY DO NOTHING;
// INSERT INTO "users" (name,billing_address_id,shipping_address_id) VALUES ("jinzhu", 1, 2);
// INSERT INTO "emails" (user_id,email) VALUES (111, "jinzhu@example.com"), (111, "jinzhu-2@example.com") ON DUPLICATE KEY DO NOTHING;
// INSERT INTO "languages" ("name") VALUES ('ZH'), ('EN') ON DUPLICATE KEY DO NOTHING;
// INSERT INTO "user_languages" ("user_id","language_id") VALUES (111, 1), (111, 2) ON DUPLICATE KEY DO NOTHING;
// COMMIT;

db.Save(&user)
```

### 通过`FullSaveAssociations`来更新关联

对于需要全面更新关联数据（不止外键）的情况，就应该使用 `FullSaveAssociations` 方法。

```go
// 更新用户并完全更新其所有关联
db.Session(&gorm.Session{FullSaveAssociations: true}).Updates(&user)
// SQL：完全更新地址、用户、电子邮件表，包括现有的关联记录
```

使用`FullSaveAssociations` 方法来确保模型的整体状态，包括其所有关联都反映在了数据库中，从在应用中保持数据的完整性和一致性。

## 跳过自动创建、更新

GORM provides flexibility to skip automatic saving of associations during create or update operations. This can be achieved using the `Select` or `Omit` methods, which allow you to specify exactly which fields or associations should be included or excluded in the operation.

### 使用`Select` 来指定字段范围

The `Select` method lets you specify which fields of the model should be saved. This means that only the selected fields will be included in the SQL operation.

```go
user := User{
  // User and associated data
}

// Only include the 'Name' field when creating the user
db.Select("Name").Create(&user)
// SQL: INSERT INTO "users" (name) VALUES ("jinzhu");
```

### 使用`Omit`来排除字段或关联

Conversely, `Omit` allows you to exclude certain fields or associations when saving a model.

```go
// Skip creating the 'BillingAddress' when creating the user
db.Omit("BillingAddress").Create(&user)

// Skip all associations when creating the user
db.Omit(clause.Associations).Create(&user)
```

{% note warn %}
**NOTE:** For many-to-many associations, GORM upserts the associations before creating join table references. To skip this upserting, use `Omit` with the association name followed by `.*`:

```go
// Skip upserting 'Languages' associations
db.Omit("Languages.*").Create(&user)
```

To skip creating both the association and its references:

```go
// Skip creating 'Languages' associations and their references
db.Omit("Languages").Create(&user)
```
{% endnote %}

Using `Select` and `Omit`, you can fine-tune how GORM handles the creation or updating of your models, giving you control over the auto-save behavior of associations.

## Select/Omit 关联字段

In GORM, when creating or updating records, you can use the `Select` and `Omit` methods to specifically include or exclude certain fields of an associated model.

With `Select`, you can specify which fields of an associated model should be included when saving the primary model. This is particularly useful for selectively saving parts of an association.

Conversely, `Omit` lets you exclude certain fields of an associated model from being saved. This can be useful when you want to prevent specific parts of an association from being persisted.


```go
user := User{
  Name:            "jinzhu",
  BillingAddress:  Address{Address1: "Billing Address - Address 1", Address2: "addr2"},
  ShippingAddress: Address{Address1: "Shipping Address - Address 1", Address2: "addr2"},
}

// Create user and his BillingAddress, ShippingAddress, including only specified fields of BillingAddress
db.Select("BillingAddress.Address1", "BillingAddress.Address2").Create(&user)
// SQL: Creates user and BillingAddress with only 'Address1' and 'Address2' fields

// Create user and his BillingAddress, ShippingAddress, excluding specific fields of BillingAddress
db.Omit("BillingAddress.Address2", "BillingAddress.CreatedAt").Create(&user)
// SQL: Creates user and BillingAddress, omitting 'Address2' and 'CreatedAt' fields
```

## 删除关联

GORM allows for the deletion of specific associated relationships (has one, has many, many2many) using the `Select` method when deleting a primary record. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining database integrity and ensuring related data is appropriately managed upon deletion.

You can specify which associations should be deleted along with the primary record by using `Select`.

```go
// Delete a user's account when deleting the user
db.Select("Account").Delete(&user)

// Delete a user's Orders and CreditCards associations when deleting the user
db.Select("Orders", "CreditCards").Delete(&user)

// Delete all of a user's has one, has many, and many2many associations
db.Select(clause.Associations).Delete(&user)

// Delete each user's account when deleting multiple users
db.Select("Account").Delete(&users)
```

{% note warn %}
**NOTE:** It's important to note that associations will only be deleted if the primary key of the deleting record is not zero. GORM uses these primary keys as conditions to delete the selected associations.

```go
// This will not work as intended
db.Select("Account").Where("name = ?", "jinzhu").Delete(&User{})
// SQL: Deletes all users with name 'jinzhu', but their accounts won't be deleted

// Correct way to delete a user and their account
db.Select("Account").Where("name = ?", "jinzhu").Delete(&User{ID: 1})
// SQL: Deletes the user with name 'jinzhu' and ID '1', and the user's account

// Deleting a user with a specific ID and their account
db.Select("Account").Delete(&User{ID: 1})
// SQL: Deletes the user with ID '1', and the user's account
```
{% endnote %}

## 关联模式

Association Mode in GORM offers various helper methods to handle relationships between models, providing an efficient way to manage associated data.

To start Association Mode, specify the source model and the relationship's field name. The source model must contain a primary key, and the relationship's field name should match an existing association.

```go
var user User
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages")
// Check for errors
error := db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Error
```

### 查询关联

Retrieve associated records with or without additional conditions.

```go
// Simple find
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Find(&languages)

// Find with conditions
codes := []string{"zh-CN", "en-US", "ja-JP"}
db.Model(&user).Where("code IN ?", codes).Association("Languages").Find(&languages)
```

### 追加关联

Add new associations for `many to many`, `has many`, or replace the current association for `has one`, `belongs to`.

```go
// Append new languages
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Append([]Language{languageZH, languageEN})

db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Append(&Language{Name: "DE"})

db.Model(&user).Association("CreditCard").Append(&CreditCard{Number: "411111111111"})
```

### 替换关联

Replace current associations with new ones.

```go
// Replace existing languages
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Replace([]Language{languageZH, languageEN})

db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Replace(Language{Name: "DE"}, languageEN)
```

### 删除关联

Remove the relationship between the source and arguments, only deleting the reference.

```go
// Delete specific languages
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Delete([]Language{languageZH, languageEN})

db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Delete(languageZH, languageEN)
```

### 清空关联

Remove all references between the source and association.

```go
// Clear all languages
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Clear()
```

### 关联计数

Get the count of current associations, with or without conditions.

```go
// Count all languages
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Count()

// Count with conditions
codes := []string{"zh-CN", "en-US", "ja-JP"}
db.Model(&user).Where("code IN ?", codes).Association("Languages").Count()
```

### 批量数据处理

Association Mode allows you to handle relationships for multiple records in a batch. This includes finding, appending, replacing, deleting, and counting operations for associated data.

- **Finding Associations**: Retrieve associated data for a collection of records.

```go
db.Model(&users).Association("Role").Find(&roles)
```

- **Deleting Associations**: Remove specific associations across multiple records.

```go
db.Model(&users).Association("Team").Delete(&userA)
```

- **Counting Associations**: Get the count of associations for a batch of records.

```go
db.Model(&users).Association("Team").Count()
```

- **Appending/Replacing Associations**: Manage associations for multiple records. Note the need for matching argument lengths with the data.

```go
var users = []User{user1, user2, user3}

// Append different teams to different users in a batch
// Append userA to user1's team, userB to user2's team, and userA, userB, userC to user3's team
db.Model(&users).Association("Team").Append(&userA, &userB, &[]User{userA, userB, userC})

// Replace teams for multiple users in a batch
// Reset user1's team to userA, user2's team to userB, and user3's team to userA, userB, and userC
db.Model(&users).Association("Team").Replace(&userA, &userB, &[]User{userA, userB, userC})
```

## <span id="delete_association_record">删除关联记录</span>

In GORM, the `Replace`, `Delete`, and `Clear` methods in Association Mode primarily affect the foreign key references, not the associated records themselves. Understanding and managing this behavior is crucial for data integrity.

- **Reference Update**: These methods update the association's foreign key to null, effectively removing the link between the source and associated models.
- **No Physical Record Deletion**: The actual associated records remain untouched in the database.

### 通过`Unscoped`来变更默认的删除行为

For scenarios requiring actual deletion of associated records, the `Unscoped` method alters this behavior.

- **Soft Delete**: Marks associated records as deleted (sets `deleted_at` field) without removing them from the database.

```go
db.Model(&user).Association("Languages").Unscoped().Clear()
```

- **Permanent Delete**: Physically deletes the association records from the database.

```go
// db.Unscoped().Model(&user)
db.Unscoped().Model(&user).Association("Languages").Unscoped().Clear()
```

## <span id="tags">关联标签（Association Tags）</span>

GORM中的关联标签通常用于指定如何处理模型之间的关联。 这些标签定义了一些关系细节，比如外键，引用和约束。 理解这些标签对于有效地建立和管理模型之间的关系而言至关重要。

| 标签                 | 描述                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `foreignKey`       | Specifies the column name of the current model used as a foreign key in the join table.          |
| `references`       | Indicates the column name in the reference table that the foreign key of the join table maps to. |
| `polymorphic`      | Defines the polymorphic type, typically the model name.                                          |
| `polymorphicValue` | Sets the polymorphic value, usually the table name, if not specified otherwise.                  |
| `many2many`        | Names the join table used in a many-to-many relationship.                                        |
| `joinForeignKey`   | Identifies the foreign key column in the join table that maps back to the current model's table. |
| `joinReferences`   | Points to the foreign key column in the join table that links to the reference model's table.    |
| `constraint`       | Specifies relational constraints like `OnUpdate`, `OnDelete` for the association.                |
