# Connecting to the database

In order to connect to a database, you need to import the database's driver first. For example:

```go
import _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
```

GORM has wrapped some drivers, for easier to remember the import path, so you could import the mysql driver with

```go
import _ "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/mysql"
// import _ "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/postgres"
// import _ "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/sqlite"
// import _ "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/mssql"
```

## MySQL

**NOTE:** In order to handle `time.Time`, you need to include `parseTime` as a parameter. ([More supported parameters](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#parameters))

```go
import (
    "github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
    _ "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/mysql"
)

func main() {
  db, err := gorm.Open("mysql", "user:password@/dbname?charset=utf8&parseTime=True&loc=Local")
  defer db.Close()
}
```

## PostgreSQL

```go
import (
    "github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
    _ "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/postgres"
)

func main() {
  db, err := gorm.Open("postgres", "host=myhost port=myport user=gorm dbname=gorm password=mypassword")
  defer db.Close()
}
```

## Sqlite3

```go
import (
    "github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
    _ "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/sqlite"
)

func main() {
  db, err := gorm.Open("sqlite3", "/tmp/gorm.db")
  defer db.Close()
}
```

## SQL Server

[Get started with SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/developer-get-started/go), it can running on your [Mac](https://sqlchoice.azurewebsites.net/en-us/sql-server/developer-get-started/go/mac/), [Linux](https://sqlchoice.azurewebsites.net/en-us/sql-server/developer-get-started/go/ubuntu/) with Docker

```go
import (
    "github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
    _ "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/mssql"
)

func main() {
  db, err = gorm.Open("mssql", "sqlserver://username:password@localhost:1433?database=dbname")
  defer db.Close()
}
```

## Write Dialect for unsupported databases

GORM officially supports the above databases, but you could write a dialect for unsupported databases.

To write your own dialect, refer to: <https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm/blob/master/dialect.go>
