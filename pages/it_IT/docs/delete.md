## Delete a Record

When deleting a record, the deleted value needs to have primary key or it will trigger a [Batch Delete](#batch_delete), for example:

```go
// Email's ID is `10`
db.Delete(&email)
// DELETE from emails where id = 10;

// Delete with additional conditions
db.Where("name = ?", "jinzhu").Delete(&email)
// DELETE from emails where id = 10 AND name = "jinzhu";
```

## Delete with primary key

GORM allows to delete objects using primary key(s) with inline condition, it works with numbers, check out [Query Inline Conditions](query.html#inline_conditions) for details

```go
db.Delete(&User{}, 10)
// DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 10;

db.Delete(&User{}, "10")
// DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 10;

db.Delete(&users, []int{1,2,3})
// DELETE FROM users WHERE id IN (1,2,3);
```

## Delete Hooks

GORM allows hooks `BeforeDelete`, `AfterDelete`, those methods will be called when deleting a record, refer [Hooks](hooks.html) for details

```go
func (u *User) BeforeDelete(tx *gorm.DB) (err error) {
    if u.Role == "admin" {
        return errors.New("admin user not allowed to delete")
    }
    return
}
```

## <span id="batch_delete">Batch Delete</span>

The specified value has no primary value, GORM will perform a batch delete, it will delete all matched records

```go
db.Where("email LIKE ?", "%jinzhu%").Delete(&Email{})
// DELETE from emails where email LIKE "%jinzhu%";

db.Delete(&Email{}, "email LIKE ?", "%jinzhu%")
// DELETE from emails where email LIKE "%jinzhu%";
```

### Block Global Delete

If you perform a batch delete without any conditions, GORM WON'T run it, and will return `ErrMissingWhereClause` error

You have to use some conditions or use raw SQL or enable `AllowGlobalUpdate` mode, for example:

```go
db.Delete(&User{}).Error // gorm.ErrMissingWhereClause

db.Where("1 = 1").Delete(&User{})
// DELETE FROM `users` WHERE 1=1

db.Exec("DELETE FROM users")
// DELETE FROM users

db.Session(&gorm.Session{AllowGlobalUpdate: true}).Delete(&User{})
// DELETE FROM users
```

### Returning Data From Deleted Rows

Return deleted data, only works for database support Returning, for example:

```go
// return all columns
var users []User
DB.Clauses(clause.Returning{}).Where("role = ?", "admin").Delete(&users)
// DELETE FROM `users` WHERE role = "admin" RETURNING *
// users => []User{{ID: 1, Name: "jinzhu", Role: "admin", Salary: 100}, {ID: 2, Name: "jinzhu.2", Role: "admin", Salary: 1000}}

// return specified columns
DB.Clauses(clause.Returning{Columns: []clause.Column{{Name: "name"}, {Name: "salary"}}}).Where("role = ?", "admin").Delete(&users)
// DELETE FROM `users` WHERE role = "admin" RETURNING `name`, `salary`
// users => []User{{ID: 0, Name: "jinzhu", Role: "", Salary: 100}, {ID: 0, Name: "jinzhu.2", Role: "", Salary: 1000}}
```

## Soft Delete

If your model includes a `gorm.DeletedAt` field (which is included in `gorm.Model`), it will get soft delete ability automatically!

When calling `Delete`, the record WON'T be removed from the database, but GORM will set the `DeletedAt`'s value to the current time, and the data is not findable with normal Query methods anymore.

```go
// user's ID is `111`
db.Delete(&user)
// UPDATE users SET deleted_at="2013-10-29 10:23" WHERE id = 111;

// Batch Delete
db.Where("age = ?", 20).Delete(&User{})
// UPDATE users SET deleted_at="2013-10-29 10:23" WHERE age = 20;

// Soft deleted records will be ignored when querying
db.Where("age = 20").Find(&user)
// SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 20 AND deleted_at IS NULL;
```

If you don't want to include `gorm.Model`, you can enable the soft delete feature like:

```go
type User struct {
  ID      int
  Deleted gorm.DeletedAt
  Name    string
}
```

### Find soft deleted records

You can find soft deleted records with `Unscoped`

```go
db.Unscoped().Where("age = 20").Find(&users)
// SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 20;
```

### Delete permanently

You can delete matched records permanently with `Unscoped`

```go
db.Unscoped().Delete(&order)
// DELETE FROM orders WHERE id=10;
```

### Delete Flag

Use unix second as delete flag

```go
import "gorm.io/plugin/soft_delete"

type User struct {
  ID        uint
  Name      string
  DeletedAt soft_delete.DeletedAt
}

// Query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE deleted_at = 0;

// Delete
UPDATE users SET deleted_at = /* current unix second */ WHERE ID = 1;
```

{% note warn %}
**INFO** when using unique field with soft delete, you should create a composite index with the unix second based `DeletedAt` field, e.g:

```go
import "gorm.io/plugin/soft_delete"

type User struct {
  ID        uint
  Name      string                `gorm:"uniqueIndex:udx_name"`
  DeletedAt soft_delete.DeletedAt `gorm:"uniqueIndex:udx_name"`
}
```
{% endnote %}

Use `1` / `0` as delete flag

```go
import "gorm.io/plugin/soft_delete"

type User struct {
  ID    uint
  Name  string
  IsDel soft_delete.DeletedAt `gorm:"softDelete:flag"`
}

// Query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE is_del = 0;

// Delete
UPDATE users SET is_del = 1 WHERE ID = 1;
```
