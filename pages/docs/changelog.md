## v1.0 - 2016.04

[GORM V1 Docs](https://v1.gorm.io)

Breaking Changes:

* `gorm.Open` returns `*gorm.DB` instead of `gorm.DB`
* Updating will only update changed fields
* Soft Delete's will only check `deleted_at IS NULL`
* New ToDBName logic
  Common initialisms from [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint/blob/master/lint.go#L702) like `HTTP`, `URI` was converted to lowercase, so `HTTP`'s db name is `http`, but not `h_t_t_p`, but for some other initialisms not in the list, like `SKU`, it's db name was `s_k_u`, this change fixed it to `sku`
* Error `RecordNotFound` has been renamed to `ErrRecordNotFound`
* `mssql` dialect has been renamed to `github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/mssql`
* `Hstore` has been moved to package `github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/postgres`
