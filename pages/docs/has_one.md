## Has One

A `has one` association sets up a one-to-one connection with another model, but with somewhat different semantics (and consequences). This association indicates that each instance of a model contains or possesses one instance of another model.

For example, if your application includes users and credit cards, and each user can only have one credit card.

### Declare
```go
// User has one CreditCard, UserID is the foreign key
type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  CreditCard CreditCard
}

type CreditCard struct {
  gorm.Model
  Number string
  UserID uint
}
```

### Retrieve
```go
// Retrieve user list with eager loading credit card
func GetAll(db *gorm.DB) ([]User, error) {
	var users []User
	err := db.Model(&User{}).Preload("CreditCard").Find(&users).Error
	return users, err
}
```

## Override Foreign Key

For a `has one` relationship, a foreign key field must also exist, the owner will save the primary key of the model belongs to it into this field.

The field's name is usually generated with `has one` model's type plus its `primary key`, for the above example it is `UserID`.

When you give a credit card to the user, it will save the User's `ID` into its `UserID` field.

If you want to use another field to save the relationship, you can change it with tag `foreignKey`, e.g:

```go
type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  CreditCard CreditCard `gorm:"foreignKey:UserName"`
  // use UserName as foreign key
}

type CreditCard struct {
  gorm.Model
  Number   string
  UserName string
}
```

## Override References

By default, the owned entity will save the `has one` model's primary key into a foreign key, you could change to save another field's value, like using `Name` for the below example.

You are able to change it with tag `references`, e.g:

```go
type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name       string     `gorm:"index"`
  CreditCard CreditCard `gorm:"foreignKey:UserName;references:Name"`
}

type CreditCard struct {
  gorm.Model
  Number   string
  UserName string
}
```

## CRUD with Has One

Please checkout [Association Mode](associations.html#Association-Mode) for working with `has one` relations

## Eager Loading

GORM allows eager loading `has one` associations with `Preload` or `Joins`, refer [Preloading (Eager loading)](preload.html) for details

## Self-Referential Has One

```go
type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Name      string
  ManagerID *uint
  Manager   *User
}
```

## FOREIGN KEY Constraints

You can setup `OnUpdate`, `OnDelete` constraints with tag `constraint`, it will be created when migrating with GORM, for example:

```go
type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  CreditCard CreditCard `gorm:"constraint:OnUpdate:CASCADE,OnDelete:SET NULL;"`
}

type CreditCard struct {
  gorm.Model
  Number string
  UserID uint
}
```

You are also allowed to delete selected has one associations with `Select` when deleting, checkout [Delete with Select](associations.html#delete_with_select) for details
